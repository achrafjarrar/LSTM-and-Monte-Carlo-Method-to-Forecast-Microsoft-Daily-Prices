This project aims at showing how an investor or a trader might employ some techniques like Monte Carlo simulation or using a RNN model like LSTM to have an idea on the evolution of the prices of stocks. In our study we will use Microsoft data. 

So the two parts are : 

* Forecast Stock Prices: Utilize historical data to predict future stock prices with LSTM. This will give us an idea on how the market will evolve in the future.

* Risk Assessment through Monte Carlo Simulation: Apply the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model within the Monte Carlo framework to assess risk and explore worst-case scenarios.
